											A land where various histories and cultures had been made for thousands of years - the history hidden in the land is seen. From the time to enjoy the pleasure of independence with the slogan of “Everlasting Independence of Korea” to the horrible time of The Korean War, the tragedy of Korean Peninsula.

											At 4 a.m. on June 25th, 1950, suspicious actions were detected in Korean Peninsula.<br>
											North Korea rushed into South Korea with tanks at the head in the code name of “Storm 244.” Gunshots and screaming swallowed the calm morning.<br>
											It was the event to divide Korean people into two, the tragic history of fratricidal war, and the start of The Korean War.<br>
											The war continued until concluding Ceasefire Agreement on July 27, 1953. And then, a new tragedy started in Korean Peninsula.<br>
											Between the south and the north, in the name of division - until present time that more than 70 years have elapsed after lowering the curtain of the war, the war in Korean Peninsula is has not been ended yet.

													<span><em>❝</em>Into the time of cold war...<em>❞</em></span>
												</h5>
												<p>
													On August 15th, 1945, Korean Peninsula achieved independence from colonization by Japan. At that time, in order to disarm Japanese army remained in Korean Peninsula, based on thirty-eight degrees north, US army was stationed in the south and USSR army was stationed in the north. The Second World War ended but armless war is not ended yet. Confrontation between liberal democracy camp focused in the USA and communism camp focused in the USSR, i.e. a conflict so-called cold war started in Korean Peninsula. In such situation, at 4 a.m. on June 25th, 1950, the North Korea passed over the 38th Parallel with tanks at the head and with the support by the USSR and China. The day was the start of The Korean War called the tragedy of Korean Peninsula.

												<h5>
													<span><em>❝</em>Ceasefire Talks - the prelude of DMZ<em>❞</em></span>
												</h5>
												<p>
													On the third day of the start of the war, South Korea gave up Seoul and was pushed to Nakdonggang River defense line. And then, South Korea recovered Seoul and swept up to Amnokgang River with the support by combined forces. However the wad did not end at this point. Chinese People’s Army joined to support North Korea on October 25, 1950. As a sign of world war was felt as shown above, secretary-general of the combined forces suggested ceasefire to both parties on June 16, 1951. UN forces and communism forces had the first Ceasefire Talks on July 10, 1951 in Naebongjang, Gaeseong. The largest issue in the talks was exchange of war prisoners. As communism forces asserted automatic return with unconditional exchange but combined forces asserted free return based on individuals’ free will, both parties’ standpoints were in a fierce standoff.

												<p>
													Strange atmosphere flowed in Korean Peninsula. Including combined forces participated in the war and Chinese People’s Army joined the war to support North Korea. In the urgent situation to cause another world war, local battles continued based on the 38th Parallel without invading other territories. That is, in order to occupy advantageous points and to provide against a bigger war by getting more land, local battles continued near the 38th Parallel in spite of the Ceasefire Talks being conducted. Therefore, many war victims were generated and many civil soldiers participated in the war were missed or dead. The dead don’t talk how much the war was horrendous in the DMZ territory. We can peep the memory of the days on the records and remains only

												<p>
													At last, Ceasefire Agreement was concluded on July 27, 1953 to stop The Korean War. Domestic and foreign war correspondents who could not enter into the room of Panmunjeom Talks tried to cover the historical event. Conclusion of Ceasefire Agreement in Korean Peninsula went into the headlines of domestic and foreign newspapers. Through “Agreement between the Commander-in-Chief, United Nations Command, on the one hand, and the Supreme Commander of the Korean People’s Army and the Commander of the Chinese People’s volunteers, on the other hand, concerning a military armistice in Korea” with exclusion of South Korea, the curtain of the war for three years and one month was let down. And then, DMZ was set based on military demarcation line. Therefore, Korean Peninsula entered into the history of division.
