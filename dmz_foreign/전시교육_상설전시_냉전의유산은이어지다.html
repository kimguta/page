											<strong>Traces of cold war hidden in Korean Peninsula</strong>
										</h4>
										<p>
											The war of flying cannon balls stopped but tragic moments hidden behind them have been continuing as the remains. From the days as cold as the iron railings which block the south and the north in Korean Peninsula, past traces which were hidden in DMZ and were not known appear now.

												<h5>
													<span><em>❝</em>The war hidden behind cold war<em>❞</em></span>
												</h5>
												<p>
													Since conclusion of Ceasefire Agreement on July 27, 1953, gunshots were not heard anymore in Korean Peninsula. However, although fly of bullets and cannon sound was suspended, the war did not end. Ideology divided Korean Peninsula. The south and the north ran on parallel roads of unavailable meet. Speakers for psychological warfare generated blames each other and gunshots continued regardless of land and sea.
												 </p>
											</div>
											<div>
												<h5>
													<span><em>❝</em>Seeking for traces of cold war<em>❞</em></span>
												</h5>
												<p>
													Based on military demarcation line, Republic of Korea was established in the south and Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was established in the north, with respective ideology. Now, Republic of Korea has a unique city which experienced both governments of the south and the north. The city is Cheolwon; Cheolwon belong to North Korea from independence on August 15, 1945 to occurrence of The Korean War and belongs to South Korea since stop of the war. In DMZ in Cheolwon, 20th Century’s historical sites containing the traces of modern and contemporary history of Korean Peninsula are dispersed here and there. The city destroyed by the war and obstructed from reconstruction by cold war Such traces of cold war still exist in many places in DMZ in the shape of being shelled and bleeding.
												 </p>
											</div>
											<div>
												<h5>
													<span><em>❝</em>Persons behind the curtain of melting pot<em>❞</em></span>
												</h5>
												<p>
													Life exists everywhere. Life is continued even in the place where cannon balls fly in and landmines explode and there are always the people to keep the place. DMZ, the ferocious battlefield of The Korean War where we cannot enter into anymore. However, in the place having the traces of the world, people lived in the past and continue their life now. Villages which are in the south and the north of DMZ, respectively. Daeseongdong Village in South Korea and Gajeongdong Village in North Korea are the very villages.
												 </p>
											</div>
											<div>
												<h5>
													<span><em>❝</em>Underground soundless war<em>❞</em></span>
												</h5>
												<p>
													Gunshots stopped on the ground but sacrifice of war is not ended. The cause of underground soundless war is landmines. By such reason, according to Mine Ban Treaty concluded in December, 1997 in Ottawa, Canada, 122 countries agreed to discard anti-personnel mines and not to produce them anymore but South Korea and North Korea which did not end the war in Korean Peninsula did not join the treaty.
												 </p>
											</div>
											<div>
												<h5>
													<span><em>❝</em>Seeking for the breath of patriotic martyrs for the country<em>❞</em></span>
												</h5>
												<p>
													The most of remains of patriotic martyrs for the country who devoted their life for the country during The Korean War are solitarily in nameless fields and mountains in DMZ. The place where the fiercest battles were fought but nobody can enter into by the last time. We hope to meet all the remains of patriotic martyrs for the country left there.
												 </p>
											</div>
											<div>
												<h5>
													<span><em>❝</em>Testimonies of the days buried in DMZ<em>❞</em></span>
												</h5>
												<p>
													The Korean War is called forgotten war or unknown war in the West including the USA and Canada because it occurred between the Second World War and Vietnamese War. But the war in DMZ was fiercer than any other wars. The ceasefire negotiation for The Korean War continued for about two years until Ceasefire Agreement was concluded on 27 July, 1953. At that time, as military confrontation line at enforcement of ceasefire is set as Military Demarcation Line, multiple fierce battles were simultaneously fought in the whole front lines of current DMZ to get more land. We should listen to the voices of victims of war fought in DMZ.
												 </p>
											</div>
											<div>
												<h5>
													<span><em>❝</em>Nature in the occupied DMZ<em>❞</em></span>
												</h5>
												<p>
													We lost lots of thing through the war. Especially, fierce battles continued in DMZ at that time. Houses and farms of the residents of the place were destroyed. High warfare to get high mountains continued and forests and plants were burnt down and disappeared. Animals lost their nests on the burnt black fields due to continuous gunshots. When the war ended, ceasefire lines were constructed and the paths of animals to move along mountain ranges were blocked. Plant seeds to be moved after attachment on animal bodies could not be dispersed anymore. The nature in DMZ had groans being occupied by the war.
												 </p>
											</div>
											<div>
												<h5>
													<span><em>❝</em>DMZ, a gage of the war<em>❞</em></span>
												</h5>
												<p>
													The war ended and, now, worn military boot soles only remained in DMZ. In the DMZ, a grave of the war, pains of the war and painful memories of the war gathered. And, there are the remains of war dead. Even in the place of continued gunshots, daily life continued and longing was kept. DMZ is the place where only the letters pressed down with deep longing for families
