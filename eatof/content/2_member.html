                                Kuangsi Waterfall is a 45-minute, 30 km drive south of Luang Prabang town. Legend has it that a hermit used a magic stick to dig for water, which sprang up and created this waterfall. A golden deer took up refuge under one of the rocks. The name of the fall is derived from this story as “Kuang” means deer and “Si” means to bore a hole. The cool stream flows down hundreds of meters over 6 cascades of limestone rocks with many pools perfect for swimming. During the rainy season, the volume of water flow increases immensely and causes erosion.
