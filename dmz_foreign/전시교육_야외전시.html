												Psychological warfare towards North Korea may noiselessly destroy the system of North Korea and is one of the weapons most worried about by North Korea. Psychological warfare is divided into four: broadcast using frequency, speaker broadcasting, large electronic display, and distribution of leaflets. psychological warfare equipment towards North Korea displayed in DMZ Museum is the ones which were demolished with determination of no mutual slander according to the agreement by South-North General Officers Talks on June 4th, 200 and is displayed for unification education and preservation of historical records and as tourism resources. Psychological warfare towards North Korea was operated again as the responsive action against 4th nuclear test conducted in January, 2016 but, as the south and north removed broadcasting facilities and sopped broadcasting by psychological warfare according to Panmunjom Declaration made on April 27th, 2018, disappeared in the history after 55 years of period.
											</p>
											<img src="/page/dmz_foreign/images/sub/outdoor04.jpg" alt="Psychological warfare equipment towards North Korea">
											<p>
												<strong>ㆍSpeakers</strong>
												Psychological warfare speakers towards North Korea displayed in the outside of the Museum have different time and regions of use. Speakers towards North Korea were installed in 94 places in whole DMZ. Effective distance was different by speaker but broadcasting could be heard at 24km in calm nighttime and at 10km in daytime in maximum.
											</p>
											<p>
												<strong>ㆍDisplays</strong>
												Psychological warfare displays towards North Korea were installed at Eulji Observatory in Haean-myeon, Yanggu-gun from 1988 to 2004. The displays were not used for broadcasting videos but for broadcasting combined letters through six displays. As the large displays emitted as strong light as their size, the letters could be identified 1-2km away from the displays and the strong light acted as a guide for North Korean defectors.

												DMZ railings installed in the Southern Limit Line of eastern front DMZ from late in 1960’s were brought as they were. You may have an indirect experience to walk between old type railings of Korean Peninsula which were removed in 2009 for replacement with new type railings in 2010. We wait for the day that our railings become the most representative symbol of division after South-North Unification like the Berlin Wall which remains as famous remains of unification of Germany.
											</p>
											<img src="/page/dmz_foreign/images/sub/outdoor05.jpg" alt="DMZ railings">
											<p>
												ㆍDouble and triple raining is installed in whole sections of the Southern and Northern Limit Lines of DMZ. The length of the double railings moved to the Museum is 250m and is equivalent to about 1/1,000 of the railings in the Southern Limit Line of whole DMZ.
											</p>
											<p>
												ㆍIn the DMZ railings, the rules to be observed by army units and posts of the Southern Limit Line are displayed and you may recall the forgotten memories of the war and practical division in Korean Peninsula. Also, may have a valuable time to think about peaceful future of Korean Peninsula walking on the road between railings surrounded by DMZ Student Art Contest Works.
											</p>

												Sculpture works made of the wire fences which had been installed in DMZ are displayed on the outdoor grass. Rusty wire fences which divided the south and the north of Korean Peninsula for a half century escaped from the function of fences and are reborn as a work to symbolize peace  How about seek for what the symbol of peace expressed by the displayed works is?
											</p>
											<img src="/page/dmz_foreign/images/sub/outdoor06.jpg" alt="Outdoor grass">
											<p>
												<strong>ㆍJin Ye (installation artist)</strong>
												The artist made art works (cloud and moon) using the waste wire fences generated during replacement of corroded railings in the Southern Limit Line. The artist intended to express our hope and wish for the dream to cure wounds of war by forming cloud and moon using rusty wire fences. The wire fences installed to remind the meaning of ceasefire are naturally corroded and break the boundary.
											</p>
											<p>
												<strong>ㆍVictor Cho (installation artist)</strong>
												The artist made a large frame of peace with use of the waste wire fences generated during replacement of corroded railings in the Southern Limit Line. The artist made a large symbol (mark) to declare peace to everybody by making a large circular frame using the rusty pole of DMZ and by connecting it with wire fences.
