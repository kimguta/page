											<span><em>4 ZONE</em> DMZ, the land that dreams</span>
											<strong>Future of reborn Korean Peninsula</strong>
										</h4>
										<p>
											What is the future of DMZ to be reborn as a new space to dream hope and peace? The place which was deemed as a land nobody can enter into has become a bridge to connect divided south and north and a space to dream new values. The one sincerely hoped for becomes reality. Let’s see the future shape of DMZ and let’s meet the future of Korean Peninsula to be reborn.

										<p>
											The purpose of UNESCO's World Heritage Sites is to preserve common remains of mankind. DMZ is the space to be alive with the scars of The Korean War as the remains of the south and the north. In addition, more than 40% of Korean plant species inhabit there and shelters are provided for endangered species including blackfaced spoonbills, mountain goats, and musk deer. Now, DMZ should be reborn as a space to be kept by the whole world escaping from a space to disconnect the south and the north each other. By doing so, a new motive to construct a peace system between the south and the north and to solve common issues will be made.

													<span><em>❝</em>Test operation of south-north railway connection section<em>❞</em></span>
												</h5>
												<p>
													Connection of south-north railway meant the moment to restore the meaning that Korean Peninsula is a peninsula country rather than an island country due to division of national territory over the meaning of connection of divided national territories. Test operation of south-north connection section which was simultaneously conducted at Geumgangsan Station in Donghae Line and Munsan Station in Gyeongeui Line was a historical event to connect the south and the north as a land on May 17, 2007.
												 </p>

											<div>
												<h5>
													<span><em>❝</em>Exchange & cooperation between south/north Gangwon-do’s<em>❞</em></span>
												</h5>
												<p>
													South/North Gangwon-do’s were a one originally. South/North Gangwon-do’s had existed in the name of Gangwon-do for more than 600 years with different historical and cultural homogeneity for thousands of years. The historical place of the basis to make us a one by connecting Geumgangsan Mountain and Seoraksan Mountain in Baekdudaegan Mountain Range is Gangwon-do. South/North Gangwon-do’s have continued exchange with installation of South/North Gangwon-do Exchange & Cooperation Committee in 1998. In 2000’s, South/North Gangwon-do’s Fork and Cultural Festival was held for playing fork games and exchanging sports and Gangwon-do will become a key to make South-North Unification earlier.

												<h5>
													<span><em>❝</em>Products of the companies of Gaeseong Industrial Complex<em>❞</em></span>
												</h5>
												<p>
													It life is changed, thought is also changed. Therefore, economic exchange was a historical event to make the basis of South-North Unification. Gaeseong Industrial Complex was a historical event that economic exchange started between the south and the north 59 years after division. On December 15, 2004, operation of factories started in Gaeseong Industrial Complex. Various kinds of business such as electricity, electronics, textile, machinery, and metal joined Gaeseong Industrial Complex and many domestic manufacturers manufactured their products in Gaeseong Industrial Complex. However, the road to the complex was disconnected in December, 2008 but operation of Gaeseong Industrial Complex is remembered as an important event to achieve economic cooperation by private sectors between the south and the north.

												<h5>
													<span><em>❝</em>Geumgangsan Mountain tour<em>❞</em></span>
												</h5>
												<p>
													On November 18, 1998, Geumgang Ferry started sailing towards Geumgangsan Mountain, a famous mountain of Korean people. At last, the sea route towards Geumgangsan Mountain, which had been dreamt, was opened. Geumgangsan Mountain is a famous place which accepted numerous worships from a long time ago due to seasonally changed sceneries. The sea route was opened half century after south-north division. And then, inland route was opened in 2003 in addition to sea route and Geumgangsan Mountain tour became active. Geumgangsan Mountain is a place where the spirit of Korean Peninsula breaths and is alive with numerous legends, fables, and folktale of Korean people. We are sincerely waiting for the day to open the route towards Geumgangsan Mountain and to make the south and the north a one through South-North Unification.
