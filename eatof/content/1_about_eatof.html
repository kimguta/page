            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
                The EATOF is an international tourism association formed in 2000 by nine local 
                governments in East Asia, with Gangwon Province leading the way. As the only 
                “cooperative body in tourism” among East Asian provinces, it strives to develop a 
                tourism community across the region and provide a solid forum to come together in unity. 
                Through collaborative efforts of each of each member province, the EATOF has sought to increase its membership, 
                reinforce the foundation for further cooperation, and ensure more active exchange between its members. 
                Ten member provinces in ten countries are currently participating, with the EATOF Secretariat located in Gangwon Province, Korea.
